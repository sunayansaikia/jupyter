Intall extension without sudo previleges
I would add that we also have this use case where we want to pre install a set of extensions for users but then allow them to add their own. 
The user accounts do not have sudo access (we are also using docker).

Note: You cannot restrict create or deletecollection requests by their resource name.
For create, this limitation is because the name of the new object may not be known at authorization time.
If you restrict list or watch by resourceName, 
clients must include a metadata.name field selector in their list or watch request that matches the
specified resourceName in order to be authorized.
For example, kubectl get configmaps --field-selector=metadata.name=my-configmap
